# dialedIn
Alright so my goal with this project is to make a webapp that allows me to track the dosage, extraction time, and final weight of espresso. 
I want this to be sorted by brand/roaster, and the specific coffee/roast. Each bag will be unique in the database, but bags of the same brand + roast
will be grouped together when viewing. Eventually I'd even like to develop an algorithm for suggesting grind/dose adjustments based on certain flavor inputs,
but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

**Current Status:**


Working on everything related to user login and the User model.



**Current ToDo:**
- Find or create a better bootstrap theme for this 
- Add admin page
- Create Extraction and Coffee models
